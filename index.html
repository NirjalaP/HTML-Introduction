    <h1>Introduction to Version Control</h1>

    <p>
        Version control is crucial for web development because it allows teams to track and manage changes to their codebase effectively. With version control, developers can work on different parts of a project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work, which is essential for collaboration on complex websites or applications. It also enables developers to revert to previous versions if new code introduces bugs or issues, making troubleshooting faster and safer. By maintaining a clear history of changes, version control systems like Git allow teams to review and document their development process, ensuring better code quality and reducing the risk of losing valuable work due to accidental deletions or errors. Overall, version control streamlines development workflows, supports teamwork, and improves project reliability.
